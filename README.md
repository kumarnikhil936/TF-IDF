# TF-IDF
For building any natural language models, the key challenge is how to convert the text data into numerical data. As the machine learning or deep learning models don’t understand the text data.Here we work with the TF-IDF method which is short for “term frequency–inverse document frequency”. This TF-IDF method is the popular word embedding technique used in various natural language process tasks.
